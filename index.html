        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>
            charity: water began with a simple mission: to bring clean and safe drinking water to people in need around the world. Every day, millions of people walk miles just to collect water—often dirty and unsafe. We believe that access to clean water changes everything: it improves health, gives children more time for school, and helps communities thrive. With the help of supporters like you, we fund sustainable water projects and share the impact with every donor. Together, we can end the water crisis.
